# OVID HOLDINGS

**Date:** 14th October 2025  
**Reference:** HCEO/MEMO/113/14/10/25  
**To:** Samson Merid, Digitization Council Member  
**Subject:** Terms of Reference - Digitization of the Ovid Holdings CEO's Executive Meeting Workflow

---

## 1. Project Title
**Digitization and Automation of the Executive Meeting Lifecycle**

---

## 2. Introduction & Background

Ovid Holdings is a dynamic and fast-paced organization. The Holdings CEO maintains a demanding schedule, engaging in approximately 20 high-level internal meetings per week with various executive teams, boards, and councils. These meetings are critical for strategic alignment, decision-making, and driving key initiatives across the holding's diverse portfolio.

The CEO is supported by a **Chief of Staff** and a **Personal Assistant**, who are integral to the current meeting workflow. The proposed digital solution must be designed to empower them and streamline their roles in managing the CEO's meeting schedule and follow-ups.

Currently, the meeting process involves manual steps for capturing and organizing information, including voice recordings and the use of NotebookLM for generating various types of reports. While effective, this process requires significant administrative overhead.

### Meeting Lifecycle Overview

The meeting lifecycle consists of three core stages:

1. **Inputs:** Agendas, issue tracking, and reviewing action items from previous meetings
2. **Process:** Live discussions, debates, idea generation, and problem-solving  
3. **Outputs:** Formal decisions, strategic directions, and new assignments

| **Gather Inputs** | **Generate Outputs** |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Collect agendas and action items | Make decisions and assign tasks |
| **Conduct Discussions** | **Engage in live discussions and debates** |

To optimize the CEO's effectiveness, Ovid Holdings is seeking to implement a comprehensive digital solution that automates the administrative and organizational aspects of the meeting lifecycle, allowing the CEO to focus entirely on providing strategic guidance, ideas, and solutions.

## 3. Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this engagement are to:

- Design a seamless digital ecosystem for managing the entire meeting workflow, from initial scheduling to post-meeting follow-up
- Automate the capture, processing, and organization of all meeting-related data, including inputs, discussions, and outputs
- Equip the CEO and support team with real-time, context-aware information (e.g., past decisions, pending action items, relevant data) before and during meetings
- Reduce the administrative burden on the CEO, Chief of Staff, and Personal Assistant, freeing up valuable time for strategic tasks
- Create a searchable, intelligent library of meeting knowledge that can be leveraged for future decision-making
- Ensure mobile accessibility for on-the-go meeting management
- Establish a secure, compliant, and scalable infrastructure for long-term sustainability

### Success Metrics & Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Time Savings:** Reduce meeting preparation and follow-up time by at least 50%
- **User Adoption:** Achieve 90%+ active usage within 3 months of deployment
- **Data Accuracy:** Maintain 95%+ accuracy in automated transcription and action item extraction
- **System Uptime:** Achieve 99.5% system availability
- **User Satisfaction:** Attain 4.5/5+ satisfaction rating from CEO and support team
- **Response Time:** Enable sub-3-second query response times in the knowledge library
